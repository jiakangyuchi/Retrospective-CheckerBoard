1. Reflect on (think about) the work you did for the challenge. How did you do? What did you get right? What did you get wrong? What did you do differently (and possibly better) than what was posted in the solution? What was hard to do?

  In my implementation, I think i met most of the requirements. It took me a lot of time to understand the whole structure of the project. But i got through it in the end. What's more, some parts are not necessary and overlaped.

2. How well did you understand the programming concepts and foundational knowledge needed to complete the challenge?

  I think I understand most of the concepts and knowledge. I was a little bit confused in the beginning, and I get some help from the recources at canvas.

3. How well did you meet the requirements as set out in the challenge? What requirements did you not meet correctly (if any)?

  I think I met all of the requirements, but the structure and functions can be improved.

4. How well does your solution match the posted solution? What is different?

  As for the aspect of functionality, all the requirements are implemented. But some parts are not efficient enough. For example, I have 
  defined variables severial times.

5. How could you improve going forward? What don't you still understand that was required for the challenge?

  Reduce unnecessary code segments, no unnecessary overlap of functionalities. And get a better understanding of the stage
